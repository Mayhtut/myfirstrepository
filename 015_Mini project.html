            A row of local-style barbecue, noodle and curry shops is located down a narrow lane behind Yone Gyi at the same level as the market (so between the continuation of Lang Ma Taw and Mingalar streets.) There’s a string of around 10 adjacent eateries – all very simple - and which seem to alternate between pick your own curry or choose your own barbecue selection. Though it’s often referred to as the town’s night market the earliest stalls open around midday, closing between 21:00 to 22:00. You’ll get a good fill here for 1,500-2,500 kyat and beer is available.

                Khaw Poat is a kind of appetizing snack of the Shan national race, who lives in the Southern part of the Shan State. Khaw Poat is not only a popular snack for the Shan nationals, but also for all nationals. We can easily eat Khaw Poat by frying or roasting it.
Khaw Poat is more delicious if you eat with roasted and pounded sesame, and brown slab sugar. And you can also eat Khaw Poat only without mixing with other ingredients.

Khaw Poat is really tasty for us unfried or unroasted and recently pounded. If we make Khaw Poat we need black and white sticky rice, pounded sesame and brown slab sugar. First, we have to pound the black sticky rice, until soft and tender.
